# Personalized Music Recommendation System

This project is a **Personalized Music Recommendation System** that suggests music based on user preferences. The system utilizes a large dataset from **Kaggle** and employs various machine learning techniques for classification and regression tasks.

## Features
- Personalized music recommendations based on user preferences.
- Implementation of machine learning models such as:
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Linear Regression**

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)** and contains information on various music tracks, users, and preferences.

## Machine Learning Techniques
1. **Decision Trees**: For classifying user preferences.
2. **Random Forest**: To improve accuracy through ensemble learning.
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: For similarity-based music recommendations.
4. **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous user ratings or preferences.

## Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (if using `.ipynb` files)

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd music-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook p.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python music_recommendation.py
   ```

## Results
The system provides personalized recommendations based on user input. The performance of each model can be evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations of the results can be generated for better insights.


## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you want to improve the system or add new features.
